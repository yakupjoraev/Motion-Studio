# DECISIONS

Every decision not already answered by another document lives here, with the evidence that produced
it. Append-only.

Its purpose is narrow and specific: to make it impossible for *"I thought this was better"* to pass
as engineering. A decision either has a criterion and a measurement, or it was the owner's call, or
it does not belong in the codebase yet.

## Rules

1. **Written before the code that depends on it.** An entry added afterwards is a rationalisation,
   and it reads like one.
2. **Append-only.** To change a decision, add a new entry that supersedes the old one and mark the
   old one `Superseded by ADR-NNN`. Never edit history — the reasoning that was wrong is the most
   useful thing in the file.
3. **Evidence, not preference.** A `Criterion` and a `Measurement` are mandatory for technical
   decisions. "Cleaner", "simpler", and "felt better" are not measurements.
4. **Consequences are stated honestly**, including the ones you dislike. An entry with no downside
   listed has not been thought through.
5. **One decision per entry.** Bundled decisions cannot be superseded individually.
6. **Numbered sequentially.** Never reuse a number.

## Entry format

`ADR-000` is reserved for this template and is never a real entry, so the example below cannot
collide with a future decision. Real entries start at 001.

## ADR-000 — Export generation runs on the main thread   (illustrative)

**Date** 2026-04-02 · **Prompt** 45 · **Status** Accepted

### Question
Should codegen run in a Web Worker or on the main thread?

### Criterion (set before measuring)
Worker if generation exceeds 100 ms on the 60-node fixture; main thread otherwise.
100 ms is the point at which a user perceives the export dialog as blocked.

### Measurement
buildIR 18 ms · print 24 ms · format 39 ms · total 81 ms (median of 9 runs,
M2 Air, no throttling). Under 4× CPU throttle: 310 ms.

### Decision
Main thread, wrapped in `startTransition`. The dialog opens before generation
starts, so the 81 ms is not on the interaction path.

### Consequences
- Accepted: on very slow devices generation approaches 300 ms. Mitigated by the
  dialog opening first and streaming files in.
- Accepted: a much larger document (200+ nodes) may cross the threshold. Revisit
  with a measurement, not a guess — ADR supersedes, not code comment.
- Avoided: worker serialisation cost, a second build target, and debugging
  across the boundary.

### Alternatives rejected
- Worker: 81 ms does not justify the complexity; measured serialisation of the
  IR alone was 12 ms round-trip.
- Incremental generation: no measured need; would add cache-invalidation surface.
```

The numbers in that example are illustrative, not measured. Prompt 45 makes the real measurement and
writes the real entry — do not copy these figures into it.

For an owner decision, replace `Criterion`/`Measurement` with:

## When an entry is required

| Situation | Entry required? |
| --- | --- |
| The answer is in `docs/` | No — follow the document |
| A threshold was measured against | **Yes** |
| Two viable approaches, one picked | **Yes** — with the criterion that picked it |
| A dependency was added | **Yes** — with the six answers from `TECH_STACK.md` § Adding a dependency |
| A documented budget was missed and accepted | **Yes** — and it must be an owner decision |
| A `docs/` document was changed | **Yes** — reference the commit |
| A feature was cut or deferred | **Yes** — owner decision only, never the implementer's |
| A licence was verified | **Yes** — see `DESIGN_REFERENCES.md` |
| Naming, formatting, file placement already covered by conventions | No |

## Decisions already made

These are recorded in the documents that own them, not here. They are listed so nobody re-opens
them without reading the reasoning first:

| Decision | Owner document |
| --- | --- |
| Monorepo with enforced package boundaries | `ARCHITECTURE.md` § Monorepo topology |
| `editor` never imports `blocks`; registry interface as the seam | `ARCHITECTURE.md` § The registry seam |
| Normalized document, not a nested tree | `EDITOR_ENGINE.md` § Why normalized |
| Immer patches as the undo unit, not snapshots | `STATE_MANAGEMENT.md` § history |
| 400 ms coalesce window | `EDITOR_ENGINE.md` § Coalescing |
| History capped at 200 entries | `EDITOR_ENGINE.md` § Limits |
| Transient gesture state never in React | `PERFORMANCE.md` § The core rule |
| Overlays outside the scene transform | `CANVAS.md` § DOM structure |
| CSS variables for theming, not class swapping | `THEME_ENGINE.md` § Why it works that way |
| Tailwind as the styling and export target | `TECH_STACK.md` § Tailwind CSS v4 |
| No styling option in export — Tailwind is the IR's model | `EXPORT_ENGINE.md` § There is no styling option |
| Zustand + Immer over Redux / Jotai / Valtio | `TECH_STACK.md` § Deliberately not used |
| dnd-kit over HTML5 drag and React DnD | `DRAG_AND_DROP.md` § Why dnd-kit |
| CodeMirror over Monaco | `TECH_STACK.md` § Deliberately not used |
| IR between document and printers | `EXPORT_ENGINE.md` § Pipeline |
| Mobile-first cascading breakpoint resolution | `RESPONSIVE_ENGINE.md` § Resolution |
| Local-first persistence, no backend | `VISION.md` § What it refuses to be |
| Reduced motion as a parallel design, not a fallback | `ANIMATION_SYSTEM.md` § Reduced motion |
| One shared scheduler for observers and listeners | `ANIMATION_SYSTEM.md` § The scheduler |
| Studio requires ≥ 1024 px | `ACCESSIBILITY.md` § Known limitations |
| Golden files plus `tsc` as the export contract | `EXPORT_ENGINE.md` § Testing |
| impeccable.style as the primary design reference | `DESIGN_REFERENCES.md` |
| Chrome takes craft, not loudness, from the reference | `DESIGN_REFERENCES.md` § Why the chrome is the exception |
| Per-package coverage floors, no global number | `TESTING.md` § Coverage contract |
| Render-count assertions over timing assertions | `PERFORMANCE.md` § Measurement |

If you believe one of these is wrong: read its document, then open an entry here proposing the
change with your reasoning. Do not work around it in code.

## ADR-001 — Documentation precedes implementation

**Date** 2026-08-04 · **Prompt** — · **Status** Accepted

### Question
Specify the product in full before writing code, or specify incrementally alongside it?

### Escalated
Owner decision at project start.

Owner's stated reason: a previous large project accumulated extensive documentation with no
implementation plan attached, and separately, long single-session builds produced subsystems that
contradicted each other. The requirement was a specification detailed enough that any individual
work session can be scoped, verified, and checked against it without holding the whole system in
context.

### Decision
27 documents specifying every subsystem, plus 62 build prompts in dependency order. Each prompt
names the documents to read, its deliverables, its constraints, its verification commands, and a
done-when checklist. One prompt per session.

### Consequences
- Accepted: the specification will diverge from the implementation in places. Prompt 61 audits for
  this, and the doc-consistency checks become tests so divergence fails CI afterwards.
- Accepted: significant work before the first line of code runs.
- Avoided: contradictory subsystems, context exhaustion mid-feature, and re-deciding settled
  questions in every session.

### Alternatives rejected
- One large prompt: exceeds usable context; produces invention where detail runs out.
- Documentation alongside code: the boundaries between packages are the hardest part and are
  cheapest to get right before anything depends on them.

## ADR-002 — No styling option in the export engine

**Date** 2026-08-04 · **Prompt** — · **Status** Accepted

### Question
`ExportOptions` originally offered `styling: 'tailwind' | 'css-modules' | 'inline'`. Can the export
engine honour all three?

### Criterion
An option ships only if implementing it is bounded by a new printer. Anything requiring a second IR
pass is a roadmap item, not a switch — because an option that silently honours one value is worse
than an absent option.

### Measurement
Traced what CSS Modules output would require against the six passes in `buildIR`. Pass 3
(`generateClasses`) is Tailwind-specific end to end: utility vocabulary, Tailwind group ordering,
breakpoint prefixes for responsive overrides, and build-time `tailwind-merge` conflict resolution.
CSS Modules needs scoped name generation, a declaration model, media queries, and its own conflict
rules — plus a parallel golden-file and compile suite. Estimated 3–5 weeks, versus roughly one week
for a genuine printer such as the component-library target.

### Decision
Remove `styling` from `ExportOptions`. Tailwind is a stated v1 constraint. Record the real cost in
`ROADMAP.md` § Post-v1 as v1.3.

### Consequences
- Accepted: users on CSS Modules or vanilla-extract cannot use the React/Next targets directly. The
  HTML target gives them real CSS rules, flattened into one document.
- Accepted: this narrows the addressable audience, and the honest framing is that it narrows it
  *visibly* instead of via a broken switch.
- Avoided: an option that appears to work and does not, which is the specific failure this ADR exists
  to prevent.

### Alternatives rejected
- Ship the option honouring only `tailwind`: a documented lie.
- Ship a naive CSS Modules path: would produce output that fails the compile test, which contradicts
  the export engine's central guarantee.

## ADR-003 — Plugin API resized from a minor release to 8–12 weeks

**Date** 2026-08-04 · **Prompt** — · **Status** Accepted

### Question
`ROADMAP.md` listed a third-party plugin API as v1.2, implying a normal release. Is that estimate
sound?

### Criterion
A post-v1 item's estimate is sound only if it accounts for the product's stated non-negotiables. Here
that is `VISION.md`'s promise that nothing leaves the browser, and there is no telemetry.

### Measurement
Enumerated what a React error boundary actually contains: a crash. It does not prevent a
third-party block from reading `localStorage`, calling `fetch`, reading the document from the store,
or mutating DOM outside its subtree. Isolation therefore requires either an iframe with a serialized
render protocol or a worker with a diff protocol — each of which changes the plugin authoring model
from "write a React component" to "target a constrained API". Adding manifest, permissions, schema
versioning, discovery, and host-migration handling puts the total at 8–12 weeks.

### Decision
Move to v1.5 with an explicit 8–12 week estimate and the reasoning recorded in `ROADMAP.md`. Ship
nothing plugin-shaped in v1.

### Consequences
- Accepted: no third-party ecosystem in the medium term.
- Accepted: user-authored custom blocks (v1.4) depend on this and inherit the delay.
- Retained: the registry-interface seam means the *host* side is already ready, so the estimate covers
  the guest side only. That seam is worth keeping regardless of whether plugins ever ship.

### Alternatives rejected
- Plugins without isolation: contradicts the local-first promise, and the promise is more valuable
  than the feature.
- Curated first-party-only extension: that is just the existing registry, so it is not a plugin API
  and should not be called one.

## ADR-004 — Package tsconfigs extend the root tsconfig until the presets exist

**Date** 2026-08-04 · **Prompt** 01 · **Status** Accepted

### Question
Prompt 01 requires every package's `tsconfig.json` to "extend the right config preset", but the
presets are a deliverable of prompt 02 (`packages/config/tsconfig/{base,library,react,next}.json`).
Where do the strict compiler flags live for the one prompt in between?

### Criterion (set before choosing)
Prompt 02 states "Then update every package's `tsconfig.json` to extend the right preset", so the
end state is fixed and identical either way. The choice is therefore admissible without escalation
only if both options converge to the same repository state after prompt 02 — they do. Among
converging options, pick the one that adds no file outside prompt 01's deliverable list and states
the strict flags exactly once, so a flag cannot drift between packages during prompt 01.

### Measurement
Option A — copy `CODE_STANDARDS.md` § Compiler configuration into each of the 16 manifests:
17 declarations of the same flag set (16 packages/apps + root), 16 of them rewritten by prompt 02.
Option B — root `tsconfig.json` carries the flag set; every package extends `../../tsconfig.json`:
1 declaration, 16 two-line child files. `references` is not inherited through `extends`, so the
root's project references do not leak into packages; `files`/`include`/`exclude` are inherited, and
each package overrides `include` with `["src"]`.
Option C — create `packages/config/tsconfig/*.json` now: adds four files that prompt 01 § Constraints
forbids ("Do not create files not in the deliverable list") and takes prompt 02's deliverable.

### Decision
Option B. The root `tsconfig.json` holds exactly the flags from `CODE_STANDARDS.md` § Compiler
configuration plus `references` to all packages; each package extends it and sets `include`.
Prompt 02 repoints every `extends` at the real preset and the root keeps only its references.

### Consequences
- Accepted: for the duration of prompt 01 the root `tsconfig.json` has two jobs — reference list and
  flag source. Prompt 02 removes the second one.
- Accepted: `tsc --build` from the root is not supported, because project references require
  `composite: true`, which requires declaration emit, which contradicts `ARCHITECTURE.md`'s
  no-build-step rule for internal packages. Typechecking runs per package via `turbo typecheck`
  (`tsc --noEmit`), which is what the root `typecheck` script does.
- Avoided: sixteen copies of a flag set that must stay identical, in the one window where nothing
  yet enforces that they do.

### Alternatives rejected
- Option A: identical end state, sixteen places for a flag to drift in between.
- Option C: takes prompt 02's deliverables and violates prompt 01's file-list constraint.
